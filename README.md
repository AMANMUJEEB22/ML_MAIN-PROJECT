# ML_MAIN-PROJECT
# Car Price Prediction Project â€“ Machine Learning Module End Project
# Problem Statement:
A Chinese automobile company wants to enter the US market. To understand the pricing dynamics of cars in the American automobile industry, they have partnered with a consulting firm. The aim is to:
   - Identify significant variables that influence car prices.
   - Develop a machine learning model to predict the price of cars based on various features.
# Business Goal:
   - Understand how car prices vary with features such as engine type, horsepower, fuel type, body style, etc.
   - Help the management in making informed decisions regarding car design and market positioning.
   - Use machine learning models to accurately estimate car prices using historical data.
     
# Steps Followed in the Project:
 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
    Loaded the dataset using pandas.
    Dropped unnecessary columns like car_ID and CarName (brand/model names with too many unique text entries).
    Handled categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
    Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure fair model comparison.
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20).
    
 2. Model Implementation 
    Implemented the following five regression models:
    Linear Regression â€“ A baseline model to understand linear relationships.
    Decision Tree Regressor â€“ Captures non-linear relationships through tree-based splits.
    Random Forest Regressor â€“ Ensemble method to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
    Gradient Boosting Regressor â€“ Boosting technique for more robust prediction.
    Support Vector Regressor (SVR) â€“ Used for capturing complex relationships in high-dimensional space.
    Each model was trained on the training set and predictions were made on the test set.

3. Model Evaluation 
   Evaluated all models based on:
   R-squared (RÂ²) â€“ Measures how well the model explains variability in the price.
   Mean Squared Error (MSE) â€“ Penalizes large errors.
   Mean Absolute Error (MAE) â€“ Average of absolute differences between actual and predicted prices.
   Best Model: Based on RÂ² score, Random Forest Regressor (or your final best model after tuning) outperformed other models due to its ability to capture non-linear patterns and feature interactions.

4. Feature Importance Analysis 
   Used the feature importances from Random Forest to identify key variables that influence car prices. Top features included:
   Engine Size
   Horsepower
   Curb Weight
   Highway MPG
   Number of Cylinders
   These insights can guide design and marketing strategies for entering the US market.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning 
   Performed Grid Search Cross-Validation on the best model (Random Forest):
   Tuned parameters: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split.
   Result: Improved model performance and better generalization on test data.

6. Timely Submission 
   The project is completed in a structured and timely manner as per the provided guidelines. Code is modular, well-commented, and outputs are clearly interpreted.

# Final Deliverables:
  A clean and readable Jupyter Notebook with:
  
  Code
  Visualizations
  Model evaluations
  Explanations
  Model comparison table



# ðŸ“Š Conclusion:

   This project successfully demonstrated how machine learning techniques can be applied to the real-world business problem of car price prediction. It identified the most influential factors for car pricing and 
   helped build a predictive model to support strategic decisions for entering a new market.
